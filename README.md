# Credit Fraud Detection using Ensemble Learning
### Trained a Random Forest to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. 
#### Dataset contains 284,807 examples each with 31 features resulting in over 8,829,017 instances parsed.
#### ** Note ** The dataset is too large to upload to github so it is left out of the repo. It can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
